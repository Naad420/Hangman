# Hangman-

This is a simple Python program that implements the classic Hangman game. The game randomly selects a word from a list of words, and the player has to guess the word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of guesses before they lose the game.

#Installation

To use this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download and install Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

#Usage

To play the game, simply run the hangman.py file in your Python interpreter. The game will prompt you to guess a letter, and you can enter your guess using the keyboard.

python hangman1.py

The game will continue until you have either correctly guessed the word, or you have used up all of your guesses. After the game is over, you will have the option to play again.
