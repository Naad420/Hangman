Hangman-

This is a simple Python program that implements the classic Hangman game. The game randomly selects a word from a list of words, and the player has to guess the word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of guesses before they lose the game.

<h3>Usage</h3>
Installation

<h3>Usage</h3>

To play the game, simply run the hangman.py file in your Python interpreter. The game will prompt you to guess a letter, and you can enter your guess using the keyboard.
